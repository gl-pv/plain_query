# PlainQuery

PlainQuery is a simple gem that helps you write clear and flexible query objects.
Main task for this gem is performing complex querying on active record relation, make it intuitive.

It helps in decomposing your fat ActiveRecord models and keeping your code slim and readable by extracting complex SQL queries or scopes into the separated classes that are easy to write, read and use.

PlainQuery is useful when you need to build one or more queries based on incoming parameters in the request. It hides scope building logic inside query class and allows you to structure the building of the scope.
## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'plain_query'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install plain_query

## Usage
### Setting up a query object
For setting up a query object you need to inherit your query class from PlainQuery.
Then you need to describe query steps by using query_step method.
Query steps perform in writing order.

```rb
class UsersQuery < PlainQuery
  model User

  query_step :filter_by_activity, if: { options[:only_active] }
  query_step :filter_by_phone_presence
  query_step :order_by_name

  def filter_by_activity
    relation.where(active: true)
  end

  def filter_by_phone_presence
    relation.where.not(phone: nil)
  end

  def order_by_name
    relation.order(name: :asc)
  end
end
```

### Query calling

```rb
users = UsersQuery.call(User.all, only_active: true)
```

Query object implements `#call` method with two arguments:

`relation` - Base scope which will be mutated inside query object. (`User.all` in example).
If you dont pass it - will be used default scope from model declaration inside query object.

`options` - Any data which will be used inside query steps or execution conditions. (`only_active: true` in example).

Query object returns scope builded by query steps execution.

### query_step
`query_step` is a main part of query building.

It declares which query change method will be executed, condition of execution and order of query change methods execution.

It has several arguments:

```rb
query_step STEP_NAME, CONDITION_OF_EXECUTION
```

`STEP_NAME` is a name of method which will be executed.

`CONDITION_OF_EXECUTION` is a method which allows or denieds execution of query step.
Type of condition can be `if:` or `unless:`. Condition definition can be proc (lambda) or some query object method name.

### Using in Active Record model scope.
First of all you need to set correct model name inside query object.

It uses for correct base scope building without passing relation to query object.

```rb
model User
```

```rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  scope :active_clients, ActiveClientsQuery
end
```

```rb
class ActiveClientsQuery < PlainQuery
  model User

  query_step :filter_by_activity
  query_step :filter_by_role

  def filter_by_activity
    relation.where(active: true)
  end

  def filter_by_role
    relation.where(role: :client)
  end
end
```

And then you can use scope from model:

```rb
User.active_clients
```

Also you can pass to Active Record scope some options:

```rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  scope :active_clients, -> { ActiveClientsQuery.call(self, option: true) }
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
